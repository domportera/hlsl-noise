# psrdnoise
Tiling simplex flow noise in 2-D and 3-D compatible with GLSL 1.20 (WebGL 1.0) and above.

A WGSL port is in the "src" directory with the GLSL versions, and it seems
to be working (yields the same results as the corresponding GLSL functions),
but I have only done a minimal amount of testing. If you find bugs, please
report them in the "Issues" section.

A variant of 2-D noise which is compatible with "mediump" 16-bit float precision
has been added to the repository. (A 3-D version is more tricky. No promises yet.)
As with the WGSL port, bug reports and general feedback on the code is appreciated.

A scientific article on this is published in Journal of Computer Graphics
Techniques, [JCGT](http://jcgt.org/published/0011/01/02/).
Code is in the src/ folder, and there are some live WebGL examples and
a tutorial on how to use these functions on
[the accompanying Github Pages site](https://stegu.github.io/psrdnoise).

The infamous troll-owned patent on Simplex Noise finally expired in January 2022,
but none of these functions implement any of the patented methods. That patent
was arguably never valid in the first place, because I would argue that its
primary claim is demonstrably false. In any case, it's a moot point now.
